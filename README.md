# Light Souls (GGJ2018@GSU)

A huge star has lost its light. Now it is full of darkness! You are the last light in the world. You need to stride over many obstacles to save your star.   The main character can transform himself into light and move between platforms. He can be reflected by mirrors or be refracted by glasses. There are many different types of platform in this game. Players need to use these platforms to reach the destination. The distance that the character can move as light only depends on how long it was charged.
